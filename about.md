## About our Site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I tried making games, wound up making a lot of libraries to support making those games, and discovered I preferred working on the libraries.
I ended up accumulating a really long commit streak on GitHub, which so far is unbroken at over 7 years.

That's most of it. Yes, I am human.
